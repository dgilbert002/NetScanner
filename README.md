# NetScanner - Enhanced Network Monitor

A real-time network monitoring dashboard with live packet capture, device discovery, and traffic analysis.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### First Time Setup
1. **Double-click `setup.bat`** - This will install everything you need
2. **Double-click `start.bat`** - This launches the server AND opens your browser automatically!

### Daily Use
Just **double-click `start.bat`** - it handles everything automatically!
- Starts the server on port 5002
- Opens your web browser to the dashboard
- Press any key in the command window to stop the server

### Two dashboards
- **`http://<this-machine>:5002/`** — the classic dashboard (mock/sample data has
  been removed; it now shows real, time-stamped collector output plus a live
  intelligence strip).
- **`http://<this-machine>:5002/intel`** — the intelligence dashboard: what is in
  use right now, what was used today, per-app/per-site time, full URLs, devices
  including phones that rotate their MAC ("Hide My MAC"), identity probabilities
  with ★ movement markers, VPN/proxy bypass findings and data quality.
- **`http://<this-machine>:5002/api/intel/*`** — the JSON API behind both.

See **[docs/INTELLIGENCE.md](docs/INTELLIGENCE.md)** for the architecture, the
API surface, the maths behind the time accounting and identity scoring, the
verification results and the known limits. `python -m pytest tests/ -q` runs the
48-test suite.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Real-Time Packet Capture** - Live network traffic monitoring
- **📱 Device Discovery** - Automatically detect devices on your network
- **📊 Traffic Analysis** - Protocol breakdown, data usage, top domains
- **🌐 Web Dashboard** - Beautiful, responsive interface
- **⚡ Live Updates** - Data refreshes every 5 seconds
- **🛡️ Windows Compatible** - Optimized for Windows networks

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Packet Capture** - Uses scapy to capture real network packets
2. **Data Processing** - Analyzes protocols, domains, and traffic patterns
3. **Database Storage** - Stores discovered devices and traffic sessions
4. **Web Dashboard** - Displays live data in an easy-to-read format

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Packet Capture**: Scapy
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Network Interface**: Auto-detects WiFi/Ethernet

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Packet Capture Not Working
- **Run as Administrator** - Right-click Command Prompt → "Run as administrator"
- **Windows Firewall** - Allow the application when prompted
- **Antivirus** - May need to whitelist the application

### No Data Appearing
- **Click "Start Real Monitoring"** in the dashboard
- **Browse some websites** to generate traffic
- **Check network interface** - Should auto-detect WiFi/Ethernet

### App Won't Start
- **Run `setup.bat`** first if you haven't already
- **Check Python installation** - Need Python 3.8+
- **Check port 5002** - Make sure it's not being used by another app

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Live Statistics** - Packets captured, bytes transferred, active devices
- **Device List** - Discovered devices with IP addresses and hostnames
- **Traffic Summary** - Protocol breakdown and data usage
- **Top Domains** - Most visited websites
- **Recent Activity** - Live feed of network activity

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Local Only** - All data stays on your computer
- **No Cloud** - No data is sent to external servers
- **Real-Time** - Data is processed and displayed locally
- **Admin Required** - Packet capture needs administrator privileges
